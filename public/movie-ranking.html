<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Braveheart</h3>
    <p>
    This is my favorite movie of all-time. Very good story with all
    ingredients a movie must have.

<h3>The Pianist</h3>
    <p>
    I love this movie because it shows very clear what we jews (our grandparents of course) have 
    experienced in WW2.

<h3>Matrix 1, 2, 3</h3>
    <p>
    Best trilogy ever. Basta!
